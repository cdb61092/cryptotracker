## 1. Total portfolio stats

This is the portfolio summary bar. It shows total portfolio value, dollar and percentage changes for the day, week, and month periods, total fiat invested, and total return thus far.

## 2. Holdings

This is your portfolio holdings. It shows the amount you own, price per coin, total value of your coin, 1d percentage change, total ROI, and a graph of the last 7 days performance. To add a coin to your holdings, click the + button in the top right of the section. Search for the coin name or symbol to select the coin. Enter the quantity, then either the price per coin, or total cost. Switch between the two by clicking the green text that alternates between "Total Cost" and "Price Per Coin". After you are done hit submit and you will see your updated holdings. To add more to a currently existing holding, click the + side at the end of the row. To remove, click the - sign.

## 3. Watchlist

This is your watchlist. These are cryptos you dont currently own but want to keep an eye on. Shows basically the same information as your holdings. To add to your watchlist, click the + button in the top right of the section. To remove from the watchlist, click the 'x' button at the end of the respective row.
