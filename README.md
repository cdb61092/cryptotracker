This is the portfolio summary bar. It shows total portfolio value, dollar and percentage changes for the day, week, and month periods, total fiat invested, and total return thus far.

To add a coin to your holdings, click the + button in the top right of the section. Search for the coin name or symbol to select the coin. Enter the quantity, then either the price per coin, or total cost. Switch between the two by clicking the green text that alternates between "Total Cost" and "Price Per Coin".
